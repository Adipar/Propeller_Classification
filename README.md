# Propeller_Classification
This program classifies the propellers of a "Pluto_X" drone being clockwise or anticlockwise propellers. Here the propellers are identified as 'A' being clockwise and 'B' being anticlockwise propeller
Here I've also uploaded the model file named as 'best.pt' 
After downloading the file you can edit the file path to your respective file path and run the program 
Remember the program will only detect on pluto Drone's Propellers so use it accordingly
for any queries or issues you can ping me on aadipardeshi@gmail.com
